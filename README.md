# JOB_RECRUITMENT

This project intends to be a simulation project to increase my own coding skill. Back-end system is based on ExpressJS framework with MongoDB and cached by a Redis server. Front-end system which will be developed soon is based on ReactJS and Redux. Any suggestions will be highly appreciated as the project is learning-on-the-go.
